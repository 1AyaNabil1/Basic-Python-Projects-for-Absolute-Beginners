## 🎮 Project Features and Workflow

1. **Set Alarm Time**:
   - Enter the alarm time in 24-hour format (HH:MM:SS).
   - The GUI provides separate fields for hours, minutes, and seconds.

2. **Start the Alarm**:
   - Click the "Set Alarm" button to initiate the timer.
   - The program continuously checks the current time against the set alarm time.

3. **Trigger Alarm**:
   - When the current time matches the alarm, a sound plays, and a pop-up message notifies the user.

4. **Error Notifications**:
   - Invalid inputs trigger an error message, ensuring smooth user experience.
