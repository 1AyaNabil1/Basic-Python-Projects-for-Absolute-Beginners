## 📂 Project File Structure

Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how this project works:

1. **Import Required Modules:**

   - `tkinter`: For creating the GUI (windows, buttons, labels, etc.).
   - `requests`: To fetch live currency data from an API.
   - `re`: To validate user input.

2. **Define Classes:**

   - `RealTimeCurrencyConverter`: Fetches live currency data and performs conversions.
   - `CurrencyConverterApp`: Handles the GUI and user interactions.

3. **Currency Conversion Logic:**

   - The user selects the "from" and "to" currencies using dropdown menus.
   - The user enters the amount to convert.
   - The program fetches the latest exchange rates and performs the conversion.
   - The converted amount is displayed in a label.

4. **Interactive GUI:**

   - Dropdown menus for selecting "from" and "to" currencies.
   - An `Entry` widget for entering the amount to convert.
   - A button to perform the conversion.
   - A label to display the converted amount.
