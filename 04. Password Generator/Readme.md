## üõ†Ô∏è Project Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have:

- **Basic Python Knowledge**: Familiarity with defining functions, handling user input, and working with strings.
- **Python Installed**: Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
- **Tkinter**: Usually comes pre-installed with Python.
- **pyperclip**: Install it using ```pip install pyperclip```

### Python Concepts Used

- **Tkinter**: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Random Module**: To generate random characters for the password.
- **String Module**: To access predefined character sets (uppercase, lowercase, digits, and punctuation).
- **Functions**: To organize code and handle password generation.
- **Event Handling**: Responding to button clicks and user input.

## üìÇ Project File Structure

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step breakdown of how this project works:

1. **Import Required Modules:**

- ```tkinter``` For creating the GUI (windows, buttons, labels, etc.).
- ```random``` To generate random characters for the password.
- ```string``` To access predefined character sets.
- ```pyperclip``` To copy the password to the clipboard.

2. **Define Functions:**

- `generate_password()` Generates a random password with a mix of uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.
- `copy_password()` Copies the generated password to the clipboard.

3. **Password Generation Logic:**

- The user selects the desired password length using a `Spinbox`.

- The program generates a password with at least one character from each category (uppercase, lowercase, digit, and special character).

- The password is displayed in an `Entry` widget.

4. **Interactive GUI:**

- Buttons for `GENERATE PASSWORD` and `COPY TO CLIPBOARD`.
- A `Spinbox` to select the password length.
- An `Entry` widget to display the generated password.
