# Hangman Game in Python 🎮  
**By Aya Nabil**  

## 🧐 About the Project  
Hangman is a classic word-guessing game that we’ve brought to life using Python. Instead of pen and paper, this digital version allows you to play solo, guessing the word before running out of attempts. It’s an engaging way to learn and practice Python while developing your own fun game.  

## 🌟 Why Play When You Can Create?  
Rather than playing games created by others, let’s take a step forward and create one ourselves. This simple Hangman game project will not only teach you Python basics but also ignite your creativity in coding. Master the most popular programming language on the planet while having fun!  

## 🧩 Features  
- **Simple Interface**: A beginner-friendly text-based game.  
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Real-time feedback on your guesses.  
- **Replay Option**: Play as many times as you like.  
- **Learn While Playing**: Practice Python functions, loops, and modules.  


## 🛠️ Project Prerequisites  
Before you start, ensure you have:  
- **Basic Python Knowledge**: Familiarity with defining functions, using loops, and handling global variables.  
- **Python Installed**: Ensure Python is installed on your system.  

### Python Concepts Used:  
- `random` module for word selection.  
- `time` module for adding suspenseful pauses.  
- Global variables for seamless data handling.  
- Loops (`for` and `while`) for efficient code execution.  


## 📂 Project File Structure  
Here’s the step-by-step breakdown of how this project works:  

1. **Import Required Modules**:  
   - `random`: For randomly selecting words.  
   - `time`: For creating pauses to enhance user experience.  

2. **Define Functions**:  
   - **`main()`**: Initializes the game variables.  
   - **`play_loop()`**: Allows replaying the game.  
   - **`hangman()`**: Implements the core game logic.  

3. **Game Logic**:  
   - Guess letters to complete the word.  
   - Each incorrect guess adds to the hangman illustration.  

4. **Play Again**:  
   - The program asks if you want to replay.  



## 🚀 How to Run the Project  

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/1AyaNabil1/Basic-Python-Projects-for-Absolute-Beginners.git  
   cd 01.Hangman  
2. **Run the Script:**
   ```bash
   python Hangman.py 
3. **Follow the Prompts:**
   ``` bash 
   Enter your guesses, and enjoy the game!
## 📸 Project Output
### Example Gameplay:
1. **Enter Your Name:**
   ```vbnet
   Welcome to Hangman Game by Aya Nabil!  
   Enter your name: Aya  
   Hello Aya! Best of Luck!  
2. **Start Guessing:**
   ```mathematica
   This is the Hangman Word: _ _ _ _ _  
   Enter your guess: a  
   Wrong guess. You have 4 guesses remaining.
3. **Final Hangman Illustration:**
   ```yaml
    _____ 
   |     |  
   |     |  
   |     |  
   |     O  
   |    /|\  
   |    / \  
   |
   
   Wrong guess. You are hanged!!!  
   The word was: python  

## 📖 Summary:
**With this project, you’ve learned how to:**

* Implement a text-based game in Python.
* Use `loops`, `functions`, and `modules` effectively.
* Enhance user interaction with pauses and replay options.

## Kudos!
You’ve not only created a game but also explored Python's core concepts. Now, share your project and inspire others to code their first game.
